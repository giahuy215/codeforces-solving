// A. Anton and Letters
// time limit per test: 2 seconds
// memory limit per test: 256 megabytes
// input: standard input
// output: standard output

// Recently, Anton has found a set. The set consists of small English letters. Anton carefully wrote out all the letters from the set in one line, 
// separated by a comma. He also added an opening curved bracket at the beginning of the line and a closing curved bracket at the end of the line.

// Unfortunately, from time to time Anton would forget writing some letter and write it again. 
// He asks you to count the total number of distinct letters in his set.

// Input
// The first and the single line contains the set of letters. The length of the line doesn't exceed 1000. 
// It is guaranteed that the line starts from an opening curved bracket and ends with a closing curved bracket. 
// Between them, small English letters are listed, separated by a comma. Each comma is followed by a space.

// Output
// Print a single number â€” the number of distinct letters in Anton's set.
