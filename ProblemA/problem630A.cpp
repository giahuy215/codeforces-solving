// A. Again Twenty Five!
// time limit per test: 0.5 seconds
// memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
// input: standard input
// output: standard output

// The HR manager was disappointed again. The last applicant failed the interview the same way as 24 previous ones. 
// "Do I give such a hard task?" — the HR manager thought. "Just raise number 5 to the power of n and get last two digits of the number. 
// Yes, of course, n can be rather big, and one cannot find the power using a calculator, but we need people who are able to think, 
// not just follow the instructions."

// Could you pass the interview in the machine vision company in IT City?

// Input
// The only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^18) — the power in which you need to raise number 5.

// Output
// Output the last two digits of 5^n without spaces between them.
