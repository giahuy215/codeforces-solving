// A. Boy or Girl
// time limit per test: 1 second
// memory limit per test: 256 megabytes
// input: standard input
// output: standard output
// Those days, many boys use beautiful girls' photos as avatars in forums.
// So it is pretty hard to tell the gender of a user at the first glance. 
// Last year, our hero went to a forum and had a nice chat with a beauty (he thought so). 
// After that they talked very often and eventually they became a couple in the network.

// But yesterday, he came to see "her" in the real world and found out "she" is actually a very strong man! 
// Our hero is very sad and he is too tired to love again now. So he came up with a way to recognize users' genders by their user names.

// This is his method: if the number of distinct characters in one's user name is odd, then he is a male, otherwise she is a female. 
// You are given the string that denotes the user name, please help our hero to determine the gender of this user by his method.

// Input
// The first line contains a non-empty string, that contains only lowercase English letters â€” the user name. This string contains at most 100 letters.

// Output
// If it is a female by our hero's method, print "CHAT WITH HER!" (without the quotes), otherwise, print "IGNORE HIM!" (without the quotes).
